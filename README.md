# Academic Honesty
If you are taking Harvard's CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science course you **must follow the course's [Academic Honesty philosophy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/)**.

It is not reasonable to access a solution to some assessement prior to (re-)submitting your own.

The essence of all work that you submit to the CS50 course **must be your own**. 

# CS50's Homepage
In this exercise I needed to create a simple homepage that introduces myself, my favorite hobbies or extracurricular, or anything else of my interest.

Creativity was something to be evaluated by the CS50's staff so I spent a good amount of time researching for implementations to make in the Homepage.

# Created with 
This webpage uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with jQuery's and Bootstrap's components.

#Access
You can access the webpage at: https://yanmaciel.github.io/harvard-cs50-homepage/index.html
  
# What I learned
After completing this exercise, I was able to get a better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and see how jQuery and Bootstrap facilitates creating a website or web app.
